# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

### Install PNPM

1. Open a new terminal in any directory and execute the following command:

```
npm i -g pnpm nodemon
```

> this will install `pnpm` and `nodemon` globably (-g) to your computer

## One Time Setup

1. Clone the repository from Git using your favorite method

2. Open a new terminal in the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```
pnpm i
```

> this will install all of the required modules for your apps

3. Create a new file in the `apps/api` directory named `.env` with the following content:

```
PORT=5001
```

## Running the project for development

1. Open a new terminal in the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

> This will run all of the apps and the api in development mode on your local machine.

### Ports

There's a lot of apps running at once when you use `pnpm dev`. Each app has a port set by default:

- `admin`: 3003
- `api`: 5001 (running on 5001 instead of 5000 to avoid conflicts with MacOS)
- `app`: 3000
- `kiosk`: 3002
- `pos`: 3001
